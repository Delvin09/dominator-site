Any financial transactions that you engage in will be conducted solely through the blockchain via the implemented in-app non-custodial wallet. We will have no insight into or control over these payments or transactions, nor do we have the ability to reverse any transactions. With that in mind, we will have no liability to you or to any third party for any claims or damages that may arise as a result of any transactions that you engage in via the Site and/or the App or using the Smart Contracts, or any other transactions that you conduct via the BSC network. BSC requires the payment of a transaction fee (a “Gas Fee”) for every transaction that occurs on the BSC network. The Gas Fee funds the network of computers that run the decentralized BSC network. This means that you will need to pay a Gas Fee for each transaction that occurs via the App. In addition to the Gas Fee, each time you utilize a Smart Contract to conduct a transaction with another user via the App, you authorize us to collect a commission of 1% or higher of the total value of that transaction (each, a “Commission”), which will be sent to a pet charity chosen by a user as a donation. You acknowledge and agree that such a Commission will be transferred directly to us through the BSC Network as a part of the transaction. As between us, you will be solely responsible to pay any and all sales, use, value added and other taxes, duties, and assessments (except taxes on our net income) now or hereafter claimed or imposed by any governmental authority (collectively, “Taxes”) associated with your use of the App (including, without limitation, any Taxes that may become payable as the result of your ownership, transfer, or minting of any “pet NFT”). Except for income taxes levied on Dominator, you: (i) will pay or reimburse us for all national, federal, state, local, or other taxes and assessments of any jurisdiction, including value-added taxes and taxes as required by international tax treaties, customs or other import or export taxes, and amounts levied in lieu thereof based on charges set, services performed or payments made hereunder, as are now or hereafter may be imposed under the authority of any national, state, local or any other taxing jurisdiction; and (ii) shall not be entitled to deduct the amount of any such taxes, duties or assessments from payments made to us pursuant to these Terms.</p>
        <p>During beta testing, Dominator does not issue NFTs and does not conduct transactions on the blockchain when generating NFT assets. Dominator makes it possible to reserve the user's right to receive NFTs at the time of the full launch of the game.</p>

        <h2>12. NOTICE REGARDING NON-FUNGIBLE TOKENS AND FUNGIBLE TOKENS</h2>
        <p>The Dominator apps is an entertainment applications, and all game items, including non-fungible tokens ("NFTs") and fungible tokens, are intended to be used within the app. Any use of these items outside the app is unintended and may pose risks, as these items may be wrongly perceived as targets for speculation and their price may fluctuate. It is important to note that these tokens are not intended to be a financial product and are not guaranteed to have any value or profit outside the app. The NFTs offered by Dominator are digital items that are created through the use of artificial intelligence and represent a unique image. Users purchase these NFTs for the purpose of owning a unique digital item, generating a unique image with the help of AI and using these items in the app. Dominator explicitly states that it does not bear any responsibility for the price of the NFTs, as the any use of these items outside the app is unintended and their price is determined by market demand and subject to fluctuations without any guarantee of value. Dominator also does not provide any assurances regarding the value or potential for profit of the NFTs. Similarly, the fungible tokens earned by users in the application do not have any inherent value or promise of profit. These tokens are not intended to be a financial product and are solely intended to be used within the Dominator application as in-game currency. It is important to note that both fungible tokens and NFTs can be freely transferred between user accounts via the blockchain. However, it is not recommended to use these tokens for any purpose other than the in-game currency. Any other use of these tokens is at the sole discretion and responsibility of the user, and Dominator is not responsible for any losses or damages resulting from such use. By using the Dominator app and its associated items, users acknowledge and agree that the app is intended to be used solely for entertainment purposes and that the items, including NFTs and fungible tokens, are intended to be used within the app. Any use of these items outside of the app is considered unintended and may pose risks, and Dominator does not bear any responsibility for such use.

        <p>The Charity feature is a built-in mechanism within our game that amasses VIGUP virtual tokens with the intention of allocating them towards philanthropic endeavours. This is not a mandate on our part, but rather an avenue through which users can influence our charitable contributions. The tokens allocated for such donations are derived from the pool of tokens not yet distributed to users, meaning that in essence, the donations are financed through our own resources.</p>
        <p>It should be expressly noted that we are under no obligation to distribute Thesee tokens to any specific organizations listed within the application. Notwithstanding, we remain committed to executing these donations unless hindered by an external party or by one of the listed organizations themselves. Any refusal or unwillingness to cooperate can be perceived as such a hindrance.</p>
